| Key | Default | Type | Description |
|-----|---------|------|-------------|
| taskmanager.memory.flink.size | (none) | MemorySize | Total Flink Memory size for the TaskExecutors. This includes all the memory that a TaskExecutor consumes, except for JVM Metaspace and JVM Overhead. It consists of Framework Heap Memory, Task Heap Memory, Task Off-Heap Memory, Managed Memory, and Network Memory. See also 'taskmanager.memory.process.size' for total process memory size configuration. |
| taskmanager.memory.framework.heap.size | 128 mb | MemorySize | Framework Heap Memory size for TaskExecutors. This is the size of JVM heap memory reserved for TaskExecutor framework, which will not be allocated to task slots. |
| taskmanager.memory.framework.off-heap.size | 128 mb | MemorySize | Framework Off-Heap Memory size for TaskExecutors. This is the size of off-heap memory (JVM direct memory and native memory) reserved for TaskExecutor framework, which will not be allocated to task slots. The configured value will be fully counted when Flink calculates the JVM max direct memory size parameter. |
| taskmanager.memory.jvm-metaspace.size | 256 mb | MemorySize | JVM Metaspace Size for the TaskExecutors. |
| taskmanager.memory.jvm-overhead.fraction | 0.1 | Float | Fraction of Total Process Memory to be reserved for JVM Overhead. This is off-heap memory reserved for JVM overhead, such as thread stack space, compile cache, etc. This includes native memory but not direct memory, and will not be counted when Flink calculates JVM max direct memory size parameter. The size of JVM Overhead is derived to make up the configured fraction of the Total Process Memory. If the derived size is less/greater than the configured min/max size, the min/max size will be used. The exact size of JVM Overhead can be explicitly specified by setting the min/max size to the same value. |
| taskmanager.memory.jvm-overhead.max | 1 gb | MemorySize | Max JVM Overhead size for the TaskExecutors. This is off-heap memory reserved for JVM overhead, such as thread stack space, compile cache, etc. This includes native memory but not direct memory, and will not be counted when Flink calculates JVM max direct memory size parameter. The size of JVM Overhead is derived to make up the configured fraction of the Total Process Memory. If the derived size is less/greater than the configured min/max size, the min/max size will be used. The exact size of JVM Overhead can be explicitly specified by setting the min/max size to the same value. |
| taskmanager.memory.jvm-overhead.min | 192 mb | MemorySize | Min JVM Overhead size for the TaskExecutors. This is off-heap memory reserved for JVM overhead, such as thread stack space, compile cache, etc. This includes native memory but not direct memory, and will not be counted when Flink calculates JVM max direct memory size parameter. The size of JVM Overhead is derived to make up the configured fraction of the Total Process Memory. If the derived size is less/greater than the configured min/max size, the min/max size will be used. The exact size of JVM Overhead can be explicitly specified by setting the min/max size to the same value. |
| taskmanager.memory.managed.consumer-weights | OPERATOR:70,STATE_BACKEND:70,PYTHON:30 | Map | Managed memory weights for different kinds of consumers. A slot’s managed memory is shared by all kinds of consumers it contains, proportionally to the kinds’ weights and regardless of the number of consumers from each kind. Currently supported kinds of consumers are OPERATOR (for built-in algorithms), STATE_BACKEND (for RocksDB state backend) and PYTHON (for Python processes). |
| taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction | 0.4 | Float | Fraction of Total Flink Memory to be used as Managed Memory, if Managed Memory size is not explicitly specified. |
| taskmanager.memory.managed.size | (none) | MemorySize | Managed Memory size for TaskExecutors. This is the size of off-heap memory managed by the memory manager, reserved for sorting, hash tables, caching of intermediate results and RocksDB state backend. Memory consumers can either allocate memory from the memory manager in the form of MemorySegments, or reserve bytes from the memory manager and keep their memory usage within that boundary. If unspecified, it will be derived to make up the configured fraction of the Total Flink Memory. |
| taskmanager.memory.network.fraction | 0.1 | Float | Fraction of Total Flink Memory to be used as Network Memory. Network Memory is off-heap memory reserved for ShuffleEnvironment (e.g., network buffers). Network Memory size is derived to make up the configured fraction of the Total Flink Memory. If the derived size is less/greater than the configured min/max size, the min/max size will be used. The exact size of Network Memory can be explicitly specified by setting the min/max size to the same value. |
| taskmanager.memory.network.max | 1 gb | MemorySize | Max Network Memory size for TaskExecutors. Network Memory is off-heap memory reserved for ShuffleEnvironment (e.g., network buffers). Network Memory size is derived to make up the configured fraction of the Total Flink Memory. If the derived size is less/greater than the configured min/max size, the min/max size will be used. The exact size of Network Memory can be explicitly specified by setting the min/max to the same value. |
| taskmanager.memory.network.min | 64 mb | MemorySize | Min Network Memory size for TaskExecutors. Network Memory is off-heap memory reserved for ShuffleEnvironment (e.g., network buffers). Network Memory size is derived to make up the configured fraction of the Total Flink Memory. If the derived size is less/greater than the configured min/max size, the min/max size will be used. The exact size of Network Memory can be explicitly specified by setting the min/max to the same value. |
| taskmanager.memory.process.size | (none) | MemorySize | Total Process Memory size for the TaskExecutors. This includes all the memory that a TaskExecutor consumes, consisting of Total Flink Memory, JVM Metaspace, and JVM Overhead. On containerized setups, this should be set to the container memory. See also 'taskmanager.memory.flink.size' for total Flink memory size configuration. |
| taskmanager.memory.segment-size | 32 kb | MemorySize | Size of memory buffers used by the network stack and the memory manager. |
| taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size | (none) | MemorySize | Task Heap Memory size for TaskExecutors. This is the size of JVM heap memory reserved for tasks. If not specified, it will be derived as Total Flink Memory minus Framework Heap Memory, Task Off-Heap Memory, Managed Memory and Network Memory. |
| taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size | 0 bytes | MemorySize | Task Off-Heap Memory size for TaskExecutors. This is the size of off heap memory (JVM direct memory and native memory) reserved for tasks. The configured value will be fully counted when Flink calculates the JVM max direct memory size parameter. |
