| Key | Default | Type | Description |
|-----|---------|------|-------------|
| cluster.intercept-user-system-exit | DISABLED | Enum<br>Possible values: [DISABLED, LOG, THROW] | Flag to check user code exiting system by terminating JVM (e.g., System.exit())<ul><li>DISABLED - Flink is not monitoring or intercepting calls to System.exit()</li><li>LOG - Log exit attempt with stack trace but still allowing exit to be performed</li><li>THROW - Throw exception when exit is attempted disallowing JVM termination</li></ul><br />Note that this configuration option can interfere with `cluster.processes.halt-on-fatal-error`: In intercepted user-code, a call to System.exit() will not cause the JVM to halt, when `THROW` is configured. |
| cluster.processes.halt-on-fatal-error | false | Boolean | Whether processes should halt on fatal errors instead of performing a graceful shutdown. In some environments (e.g. Java 8 with the G1 garbage collector), a regular graceful shutdown can lead to a JVM deadlock. See [FLINK-16510](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-16510) for details. |
