| kubernetes.jobmanager.cpu | 1.0 | Double | The number of cpu used by job manager |
| kubernetes.jobmanager.labels | (none) | Map | The labels to be set for JobManager pod. Specified as key:value pairs separated by commas. For example, version:alphav1,deploy:test. |
| kubernetes.jobmanager.node-selector | (none) | Map | The node selector to be set for JobManager pod. Specified as key:value pairs separated by commas. For example, environment:production,disk:ssd. |
| kubernetes.jobmanager.owner.reference | (none) | List&lt;Map&gt; | The user-specified [Owner References](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/deployment/resource-providers/native_kubernetes.html#manual-resource-cleanup) to be set to the JobManager Deployment. When all the owner resources are deleted, the JobManager Deployment will be deleted automatically, which also deletes all the resources created by this Flink cluster. The value should be formatted as a semicolon-separated list of owner references, where each owner reference is a comma-separated list of `key:value` pairs. E.g., apiVersion:v1,blockOwnerDeletion:true,controller:true,kind:FlinkApplication,name:flink-app-name,uid:flink-app-uid;apiVersion:v1,kind:Deployment,name:deploy-name,uid:deploy-uid |
| kubernetes.jobmanager.service-account | (none) | String | Service account that is used by jobmanager within kubernetes cluster. The job manager uses this service account when requesting taskmanager pods from the API server. If not explicitly configured, config option 'kubernetes.service-account' will be used. |
| kubernetes.jobmanager.tolerations | (none) | List&lt;Map&gt; | The user-specified tolerations to be set to the JobManager pod. The value should be in the form of key:key1,operator:Equal,value:value1,effect:NoSchedule;key:key2,operator:Exists,effect:NoExecute,tolerationSeconds:6000 |
| kubernetes.namespace | "default" | String | The namespace that will be used for running the jobmanager and taskmanager pods. |
| kubernetes.rest-service.annotations | (none) | Map | The user-specified annotations that are set to the rest Service. The value should be in the form of a1:v1,a2:v2 |
| kubernetes.rest-service.exposed.type | LoadBalancer | Enum<br>Possible values: [ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer] | The exposed type of the rest service (ClusterIP or NodePort or LoadBalancer). The exposed rest service could be used to access the Flinkâ€™s Web UI and REST endpoint. |
| kubernetes.secrets | (none) | Map | The user-specified secrets that will be mounted into Flink container. The value should be in the form of `foo:/opt/secrets-foo,bar:/opt/secrets-bar`. |
| kubernetes.service-account | "default" | String | Service account that is used by jobmanager and taskmanager within kubernetes cluster. Notice that this can be overwritten by config options 'kubernetes.jobmanager.service-account' and 'kubernetes.taskmanager.service-account' for jobmanager and taskmanager respectively. |
| kubernetes.taskmanager.annotations | (none) | Map | The user-specified annotations that are set to the TaskManager pod. The value could be in the form of a1:v1,a2:v2 |
| kubernetes.taskmanager.cpu | -1.0 | Double | The number of cpu used by task manager. By default, the cpu is set to the number of slots per TaskManager |
| kubernetes.taskmanager.labels | (none) | Map | The labels to be set for TaskManager pods. Specified as key:value pairs separated by commas. For example, version:alphav1,deploy:test. |
| kubernetes.taskmanager.node-selector | (none) | Map | The node selector to be set for TaskManager pods. Specified as key:value pairs separated by commas. For example, environment:production,disk:ssd. |
| kubernetes.taskmanager.service-account | (none) | String | Service account that is used by taskmanager within kubernetes cluster. The task manager uses this service account when watching config maps on the API server to retrieve leader address of jobmanager and resourcemanager.
