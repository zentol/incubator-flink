| jobmanager.memory.enable-jvm-direct-memory-limit | false | Boolean | Whether to enable the JVM direct memory limit of the JobManager process (-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize). The limit will be set to the value of 'jobmanager.memory.off-heap.size' option.  |
| jobmanager.memory.flink.size | (none) | MemorySize | Total Flink Memory size for the JobManager. This includes all the memory that a JobManager consumes, except for JVM Metaspace and JVM Overhead. It consists of JVM Heap Memory and Off-heap Memory. See also 'jobmanager.memory.process.size' for total process memory size configuration. |
| jobmanager.memory.heap.size | (none) | MemorySize | JVM Heap Memory size for JobManager. The minimum recommended JVM Heap size is 128.000mb (134217728 bytes). |

| taskmanager.memory.managed.consumer-weights | OPERATOR:70,STATE_BACKEND:70,PYTHON:30 | Map | Managed memory weights for different kinds of consumers. A slot’s managed memory is shared by all kinds of consumers it contains, proportionally to the kinds’ weights and regardless of the number of consumers from each kind.

| taskmanager.memory.managed.size | (none) | MemorySize | Managed Memory size for TaskExecutors. This is the size of off-heap memory managed by the memory manager, reserved for sorting, hash tables, caching of intermediate results and RocksDB state backend. Memory consumers can either allocate memory from the memory manager in the form of MemorySegments, or reserve bytes from the memory manager and keep their memory usage within that boundary. If unspecified, it will be derived to make up the configured fraction of the Total Flink Memory. |
