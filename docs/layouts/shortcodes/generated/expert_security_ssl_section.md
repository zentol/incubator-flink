| Key | Default | Type | Description |
|-----|---------|------|-------------|
| security.ssl.internal.close-notify-flush-timeout | -1 | Integer | The timeout (in ms) for flushing the `close_notify` that was triggered by closing a channel. If the `close_notify` was not flushed in the given timeout the channel will be closed forcibly. (-1 = use system default) |
| security.ssl.internal.handshake-timeout | -1 | Integer | The timeout (in ms) during SSL handshake. (-1 = use system default) |
| security.ssl.internal.session-cache-size | -1 | Integer | The size of the cache used for storing SSL session objects. According to [here](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/832), you should always set this to an appropriate number to not run into a bug with stalling IO threads during garbage collection. (-1 = use system default). |
| security.ssl.internal.session-timeout | -1 | Integer | The timeout (in ms) for the cached SSL session objects. (-1 = use system default) |
| security.ssl.provider | "JDK" | String | The SSL engine provider to use for the ssl transport:<ul><li>`JDK`: default Java-based SSL engine</li><li>`OPENSSL`: openSSL-based SSL engine using system libraries</li></ul>`OPENSSL` is based on [netty-tcnative](http://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html#wiki-h2-4) and comes in two flavours:<ul><li>dynamically linked: This will use your system's openSSL libraries (if compatible) and requires `opt/flink-shaded-netty-tcnative-dynamic-*.jar` to be copied to `lib/`</li><li>statically linked: Due to potential licensing issues with openSSL (see [LEGAL-393](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-393)), we cannot ship pre-built libraries. However, you can build the required library yourself and put it into `lib/`:<br />`git clone https://github.com/apache/flink-shaded.git && cd flink-shaded && mvn clean package -Pinclude-netty-tcnative-static -pl flink-shaded-netty-tcnative-static`</li></ul> |
