| Key | Default | Type | Description |
|-----|---------|------|-------------|
| jobmanager.rpc.address | (none) | String | The config parameter defining the network address to connect to for communication with the job manager. This value is only interpreted in setups where a single JobManager with static name or address exists (simple standalone setups, or container setups with dynamic service name resolution). It is not used in many high-availability setups, when a leader-election service (like ZooKeeper) is used to elect and discover the JobManager leader from potentially multiple standby JobManagers. |
| jobmanager.rpc.port | 6123 | Integer | The config parameter defining the network port to connect to for communication with the job manager. Like jobmanager.rpc.address, this value is only interpreted in setups where a single JobManager with static name/address and port exists (simple standalone setups, or container setups with dynamic service name resolution). This config option is not used in many high-availability setups, when a leader-election service (like ZooKeeper) is used to elect and discover the JobManager leader from potentially multiple standby JobManagers. |
| metrics.internal.query-service.port | "0" | String | The port range used for Flink's internal metric query service. Accepts a list of ports (“50100,50101”), ranges(“50100-50200”) or a combination of both. It is recommended to set a range of ports to avoid collisions when multiple Flink components are running on the same machine. Per default Flink will pick a random port. |
| rest.address | (none) | String | The address that should be used by clients to connect to the server. Attention: This option is respected only if the high-availability configuration is NONE. |
| rest.bind-address | (none) | String | The address that the server binds itself. |
| rest.bind-port | "8081" | String | The port that the server binds itself. Accepts a list of ports (“50100,50101”), ranges (“50100-50200”) or a combination of both. It is recommended to set a range of ports to avoid collisions when multiple Rest servers are running on the same machine. |
| rest.port | 8081 | Integer | The port that the client connects to. If rest.bind-port has not been specified, then the REST server will bind to this port. Attention: This option is respected only if the high-availability configuration is NONE. |
| taskmanager.data.port | 0 | Integer | The task manager’s external port used for data exchange operations. |
| taskmanager.host | (none) | String | The external address of the network interface where the TaskManager is exposed. Because different TaskManagers need different values for this option, usually it is specified in an additional non-shared TaskManager-specific config file. |
| taskmanager.rpc.port | "0" | String | The external RPC port where the TaskManager is exposed. Accepts a list of ports (“50100,50101”), ranges (“50100-50200”) or a combination of both. It is recommended to set a range of ports to avoid collisions when multiple TaskManagers are running on the same machine. |
