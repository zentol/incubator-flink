| Key | Default | Type | Description |
|-----|---------|------|-------------|
| classloader.check-leaked-classloader | true | Boolean | Fails attempts at loading classes if the user classloader of a job is used after it has terminated.<br />This is usually caused by the classloader being leaked by lingering threads or misbehaving libraries, which may also result in the classloader being used by other jobs.<br />This check should only be disabled if such a leak prevents further jobs from running. |
| classloader.fail-on-metaspace-oom-error | true | Boolean | Fail Flink JVM processes if 'OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace' is thrown while trying to load a user code class. |
| classloader.parent-first-patterns.additional | (none) | String | A (semicolon-separated) list of patterns that specifies which classes should always be resolved through the parent ClassLoader first. A pattern is a simple prefix that is checked against the fully qualified class name. These patterns are appended to "classloader.parent-first-patterns.default". |
| classloader.parent-first-patterns.default | "java.;<wbr>scala.;<wbr>org.apache.flink.;<wbr>com.esotericsoftware.kryo;<wbr>org.apache.hadoop.;<wbr>javax.annotation.;<wbr>org.slf4j;<wbr>org.apache.log4j;<wbr>org.apache.logging;<wbr>org.apache.commons.logging;<wbr>ch.qos.logback;<wbr>org.xml;<wbr>javax.xml;<wbr>org.apache.xerces;<wbr>org.w3c" | String | A (semicolon-separated) list of patterns that specifies which classes should always be resolved through the parent ClassLoader first. A pattern is a simple prefix that is checked against the fully qualified class name. This setting should generally not be modified. To add another pattern we recommend to use "classloader.parent-first-patterns.additional" instead. |
| classloader.resolve-order | "child-first" | String | Defines the class resolution strategy when loading classes from user code, meaning whether to first check the user code jar ("child-first") or the application classpath ("parent-first"). The default settings indicate to load classes first from the user code jar, which means that user code jars can include and load different dependencies than Flink uses (transitively). |
| fs.allowed-fallback-filesystems | (none) | String | A (semicolon-separated) list of file schemes, for which Hadoop can be used instead of an appropriate Flink plugin. (example: s3;wasb) |
| fs.default-scheme | (none) | String | The default filesystem scheme, used for paths that do not declare a scheme explicitly. May contain an authority, e.g. host:port in case of an HDFS NameNode. |
| fs.output.always-create-directory | false | Boolean | File writers running with a parallelism larger than one create a directory for the output file path and put the different result files (one per parallel writer task) into that directory. If this option is set to "true", writers with a parallelism of 1 will also create a directory and place a single result file into it. If the option is set to "false", the writer will directly create the file directly at the output path, without creating a containing directory. |
| fs.overwrite-files | false | Boolean | Specifies whether file output writers should overwrite existing files by default. Set to "true" to overwrite by default,"false" otherwise. |
| io.tmp.dirs | 'LOCAL_DIRS' on Yarn. '_FLINK_TMP_DIR' on Mesos. System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir") in standalone. | String | Directories for temporary files, separated by",", "|", or the system's java.io.File.pathSeparator. |
| parallelism.default | 1 | Integer | Default parallelism for jobs. |
